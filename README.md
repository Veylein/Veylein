⚡ Who I Am:

I’m Veylein — chaotic coder, creative instigator, and all-around builder of weird, wild worlds. From bots to mods to music, I don’t just make things… I make everything a little more interesting. Life’s too short to play safe, so I break rules, bend games, and leave a trail of confusion wherever I go. 😎🔥

⸻

💻 What I Build:
	•	Discord bots & automation (Ludus, Pax, Vilicous, soon: Conditor)
	•	Minecraft mods, plugins, resource packs & a fully hosted server
	•	Roblox games & Among Us mods
	•	Websites, templates, and tools for creators everywhere

Everything I make is public — no secrets, no gatekeeping. Need help? Hit me up at Psyvrse@gmail.com.

🎨 What I Love:
	•	Creating & coding with AI 🤖
	•	Games, music, art, and chaos 🎮🎧🎨
	•	Animals 🐾 (better than most humans)
	•	Autumn & winter aesthetics 🍂❄️
	•	Friends, fun, and random mischief 🫂✨

⸻

🖤 What I Don’t:

Egos, fake people, greed, and rules that make no sense. Basically… stay 20 ft away if you’re not cool. 😭🖕

🌈 Extra Chaos Info:

Bisexual, constantly leveling up IRL, and always looking for a reason to push boundaries.
